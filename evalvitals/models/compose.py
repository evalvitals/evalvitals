"""compose() — combine a ModelSpec with a Backend into a Model.

This is where the orthogonal decomposition becomes a single object:

    handle = compose(spec, "hf_local", want={Capability.ATTENTION})

Capability negotiation happens HERE (before any weights load): if you ask for
``ATTENTION`` against the ``api`` backend, you get a clear :class:`CapabilityError`
up front rather than a crash deep inside a hook.  ``api_only`` specs (closed
weights) refuse every backend except ``api``.
