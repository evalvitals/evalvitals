"""Base class for black-box (API-only) models.

Black-box models have no parameter access, so they provide only output-level
capabilities (``GENERATE``, sometimes ``LOGITS``).  Capability matching means
attention/saliency/probing analyzers are simply *not offered* for them — the
agent sees an empty (or small) compatible-analyzer set and never tries.
