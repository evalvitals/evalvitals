  network and no repo mutation
- the profile's "columns" block gives each column's role (id / outcome / group

The RAW M1-style output is at "{raw_input_dir}/" in the current working

sample of entries — NOT parsed rows):
{folder_scan}

Write a self-contained Python script that performs a THOROUGH, Lambda-style
exploratory analysis and PRODUCES A RICH SET OF CHARTS BY DEFAULT.

Setup:
- FIRST, load and organize the raw data into ONE tidy table YOURSELF — this is
  part of your job, not a solved input. The files under "{raw_input_dir}/" may
  be a single file or many, and each file's JSON shape is not guaranteed: it
  could already be a flat list of row dicts, JSONL (one JSON object per line),
  or a dict holding scalar run/file metadata (e.g. "model", "seed") alongside
  a list of per-case records under a conventional key such as "cases" /
  "results" / "rows" / "items" / "data" / "examples" / "samples" — or
  something else entirely. Inspect what is actually there before assuming a
  shape. If a file wraps a list of per-case dicts alongside scalar metadata,
  merge that metadata into every row it produces (e.g. a per-model file's
  "model" field becomes a "model" column on each of that file's rows).
{outcome_hint}- after building the tidy table, determine whether it has a recognizable
  outcome column (binary / categorical / continuous) or none at all — do NOT
  invent a FAIL/PASS split when there is no such column.
- also write the tidy table you built to "{input_filename}" (a JSON list of
  row dicts) in the current working directory, so it is available to whoever
  reviews this analysis afterward.

  network and no repo mutation

_GENERIC_FRAMING = """\
OUTCOME FRAMING — apply whichever case matches what you find after loading:
  - BINARY outcome (2 distinct values in some column): call the two groups
    FAIL and PASS and tell the FAIL-vs-PASS story — class balance; per numeric
    signal vs FAIL/PASS (distribution view + binned fail-rate curve); a ranked
    bar of each signal's FAIL-vs-PASS separation; fail rate by categorical
    group columns; signal correlations; 1-2 scatter plots of the most
    discriminative pairs coloured by outcome.
  - CATEGORICAL outcome (3+ classes): tell the per-class story — do NOT
    collapse it into a binary split. Class balance per class; per numeric
    signal's distribution across classes (box/violin) plus a ranked
    cross-class separation bar; class composition by categorical group
    columns; signal correlations; 1-2 scatter plots coloured by class.
  - CONTINUOUS outcome: a correlation/regression-style story — do not
    binarize it unless the question explicitly asks for that. Outcome
    distribution; per numeric signal vs outcome (scatter + trend line, plus a
    binned mean-outcome curve); a ranked bar of correlation magnitude with the
    outcome; outcome distribution by categorical group columns; predictor
    correlation heatmap; 1-2 scatter plots of the most associated pairs.
  - NO recognizable outcome/target column: unsupervised exploration — describe
    structure, do NOT invent a label that isn't in the data. Missingness
    overview; per-numeric-column distributions; per-categorical-column value
    counts (skip columns with very high cardinality as a bar chart, note it in
    caveats); correlation table/heatmap; 1-2 scatter plots of the most
    correlated numeric pairs; if a group/time column exists, contrast numeric
    distributions across it."""

_ANALYSIS_CONTRACT = """\
VISUAL ANALYSIS — before writing plotting code, make an explicit intermediate
visualization plan. The plan is part of the machine-readable output and should
show that YOU selected plot types from the data semantics, not from a fixed
template. Aim for 6-12 charts/plots that together tell the dataset's story.

First build a "visual_plan" list. Each item should be a dict:
  {{
    "name": "<stable artifact/chart name>",
    "display_name": "<short human title, no raw generated/probe id>",
    "question": "<what this visual answers>",
    "data_shape": "<numeric-vs-binary | numeric-vs-categorical | numeric-vs-numeric | many-numeric | paired | unsupervised | ...>",
    "plot_kind": "<chosen plot type, e.g. bar, line, scatter, box, violin, heatmap, paired_slope>",
    "fallback_kind": "<bar|line|scatter when a deterministic host chart is useful>",
    "required_columns": ["..."],
    "rationale": "<why this plot type fits the data and avoids misleading summaries>"
  }}

Use these decision principles:
  - categorical/binary outcome: rate/count bar with n annotated in the table.
  - numeric predictor vs categorical/binary outcome: prefer distribution views
    (box/violin/strip) when writing rich PNG plots; include a deterministic
    summary chart only when useful.
  - binned numeric trend (event rate, or mean of a continuous outcome): line
    over ordered bins/percentiles.
  - numeric vs numeric: scatter, optionally colored/stratified by outcome or group.
  - many numeric signals: ranked effect/association bar plus correlation heatmap.
  - paired/intervention data: paired slope or discordant-count visual.
  - no outcome column: prioritize distributions, missingness, correlation
    structure, and group contrasts over any label-vs-label story.
  - skip a planned visual when required columns are absent or sample size makes it
    misleading; say so in caveats.

For EVERY chart you report in "charts":
- write its plotted data as a CSV under "tables/<name>.csv"
- add a spec {{"name","display_name","kind","data","x","y","title"}} with data="tables/<name>.csv"
  and kind in {{"bar","line","scatter"}}. The HOST renders these deterministically,
  so PRE-AGGREGATE distributions into the CSV (histogram = bin->count; outcome
  rate or mean-outcome curve = bin->value; group comparison = group->value) —
  never rely on a raw dump.
ADDITIONALLY you MAY draw richer figures (box / violin / heatmap / scatter-matrix)
directly as PNG under "figures/" and list them in "plots"; a figure-styling skill
(when available) will make these publication-quality.

This is PURE EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS. Describe what the data shows. Do NOT
propose causal explanations, do NOT claim anything is "confirmed" or
"validated", and do NOT frame findings as hypotheses to be tested — hypothesis
generation and validation are a different, separate step that this tool does
not perform. Stick to descriptive, evidence-grounded statements.

Takeaways (THE PRIMARY OUTPUT — this is what a reader sees first):
- "takeaways": a ranked list of 4-8 dicts, most important/surprising finding
  first, each shaped exactly like:
    {{"title": "<one punchy sentence — the finding itself, with real numbers>",
      "chart_names": ["<name(s) from 'charts' or 'plots' that support it>"],
      "table_names": ["<key(s) from 'tables' that support it, if any>"],
      "analysis": "<2-4 sentences explaining WHY this matters, citing the
                    actual numbers/columns behind the chart(s)>",
      "caveat": "<what this does NOT show, or '' if nothing notable>"}}
  EVERY important chart/plot you produce should be referenced by at least one
  takeaway's "chart_names" — never leave a chart orphaned with no explanation,
  and never write a takeaway with no supporting chart/table unless the data
  genuinely has none to offer (rare).

Report/dashboard contract:
- Emit ONE "dashboard_storyboard" panel dict (a list with one entry) orienting
  the reader on the data/question before the takeaways:
    {{"id": "problem_setting", "title": "Problem Setting", "summary": "...",
      "items": ["..."], "artifact_refs": ["data_profile"]}}
  Do not add "analysis" or "hypotheses" panels — "takeaways" already covers
  that ground, and this tool does not generate hypotheses.

Secondary fields (for programmatic consumers such as a downstream confirmatory
pipeline — NOT the primary reader-facing narrative; keep these terse):
- add "chart_readings": one short dict per important visual with
  {{"chart": "<name/title>", "reading": "<what a human should see>",
  "do_not_infer": "<what this chart cannot prove>"}}.
- add "claims" only for carefully worded descriptive/confirmable statements. Each
  claim must cite chart/signal identifiers in "evidence_ids"; set status to
  "descriptive" (never "supported" — this tool does not confirm anything).
- add "critique": agent self-audit notes about leakage, small n, double-dipping,
  missingness, misleading plot choices, or alternative explanations.
- Never use raw internal IDs like "generated_probe1_false_detection" as user-facing
  chart titles or claim text. Use display names such as "Sanity check: probe
  false-detection flag", and demote probe-derived fields to sanity-check
  evidence rather than explanatory findings.
- PREFERRED: for any composite / threshold / interaction signal that is a
  DETERMINISTIC FUNCTION of the numeric columns, attach a "recipe" so a
  downstream confirmatory pipeline can compute it on a HELD-OUT split later
  (this tool itself does not run that confirmation):
    "recipe": {{"name": "<new signal key>", "kind": "expr",
                "expr": "<boolean/numeric expression over the numeric columns above>"}}
  The expr may use the columns BY NAME, comparisons (< <= > >= == !=), and/or/not,
  arithmetic (+ - * / %), and abs/min/max/float/int/len. It must NOT reference the
  label/outcome column (a recipe is a PREDICTOR, never the answer). Example:
    "recipe": {{"name": "small_and_peripheral", "kind": "expr", "expr": "(obj_size < 40) and (focus_share < 0.3)"}}
  Emit a recipe rather than prose whenever the candidate is computable from the columns.
- ALTERNATIVELY, you MAY attach host-adjudicable "sufficient" statistics computed
  from the rows, as ONE of these shapes:
    {{"kind": "two_group", "a": [0/1, ...], "b": [0/1, ...]}}   # is_fail indicators among signal-ABSENT (a) vs signal-PRESENT (b) cases
    {{"kind": "paired_binary", "b": <int>, "c": <int>}}          # discordant counts of a paired intervention (b = flips the good way, c = the bad way)
  Do NOT emit "reject"/"e_value"/"p_value" anywhere — this tool never adjudicates
  a verdict itself; a self-declared verdict is ignored. Omit both for
  descriptive-only signals.
- prints the final result as the LAST stdout line exactly like (note "charts" is a
  RICH list here, one entry per CSV you wrote). The example below illustrates the
  JSON SHAPE using a binary-outcome dataset; KEEP THE SAME KEYS but replace the
  FAIL/PASS/fail_rate wording with language that matches the ACTUAL outcome kind
  from the profile above (categorical classes, a continuous outcome's mean/curve,
  or plain unsupervised structure when there is no outcome):
