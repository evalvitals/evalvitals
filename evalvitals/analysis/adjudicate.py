"""Host-side adjudication of explorer candidate signals (the firewall).

The :mod:`~evalvitals.analysis.explorer` PROPOSES candidate signals; it has no
authority to declare significance. This module is the host firewall: it takes the
host-adjudicable ``sufficient`` statistics an explorer attached to a candidate and
recomputes the verdict with the SAME validated, multiplicity-aware core the M2
stats engine uses — never trusting a ``reject`` / ``e_value`` / ``p_value`` the
explorer self-declared (the explorer schema does not even carry one).

Mechanics (mirror ``stats_tools`` / ``stats_tool_generator`` exactly):

- ``_reconstruct_decision`` turns sufficient statistics into
  ``(reject, e_value, effect, ci)`` via the validated core.
- ``fdr_correct`` applies e-BH across every candidate that produced an e-value
  (the ``paired_binary`` shape), so proposing more candidates pays more
  multiplicity — exactly one e-BH family, no per-candidate self-rejection.
- A ``two_group`` candidate yields a bootstrap-CI reject but no e-value (matching
  the ``signal_label_assoc`` catalog tool). It is host-adjudicated but sits
  OUTSIDE the e-BH family and is flagged ``fdr_corrected=False`` — honest, not
  over-claimed.
- A candidate with no adjudicable ``sufficient`` is ``descriptive_only`` and never
  rejects.

IMPORTANT — split discipline: in the standalone chat path the candidate's
``sufficient`` is computed on the SAME rows used to discover the signal. That is
IN-SAMPLE; ``split_label`` records it so nothing over-claims, and an honest caveat
is appended. Held-out CONFIRM-split adjudication (selecting on EXPLORE, computing
each e-value on a disjoint CONFIRM split) is the job of the fused pipeline
(Phase B). This module supplies only the verdict mechanism.
