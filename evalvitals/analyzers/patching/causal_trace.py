"""Activation patching / causal tracing (Meng et al., ROME) (Stage 2).

The only CAUSAL white-box method here: read a clean run's activations and WRITE
them into a corrupted run to localise where information is causally used.
``requires=HIDDEN_STATES`` (read+write hooks — via nnsight). Memory ∝ layers×positions.
