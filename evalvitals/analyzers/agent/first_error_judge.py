"""First-error attribution — LLM-as-judge (the Who&When 'all-at-once' protocol).

Given a trajectory, ask a JUDGE model which step first introduced the error.
The judge is a separate handle (judge != system-under-test, to avoid
self-preference bias).  Writes ``is_first_error`` onto the implicated step.

Reliability caveats (bake into any reporting): LLM judges show position/length
bias and self-preference; calibrate against a human-gold subset and report
step-accuracy/F1.  As reported by Zhang et al. (Who&When), even strong judges
reach only ~14% step-level accuracy — treat outputs as weak signal, not truth.
