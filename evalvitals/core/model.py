"""Model — the abstract contract every analyzable model implements.

The key design move: a model exposes **one** rich forward pass,
``forward(inputs, capture={...}) -> Trace``, where ``capture`` names the
internals to record (attention, hidden states, …).  Analyzers consume the
``Trace``, not the model's framework-specific guts.  This decouples "run the
model and grab internals" from "interpret the internals", so one model serves
every compatible analyzer and one analyzer works across every compatible model.

The hybrid convenience API (``model.call_attention(prompt)``) is provided here
by ``__getattr__``: it resolves ``attention`` in the analyzer registry, checks
the model supports it, and delegates to ``AttentionAnalyzer().run(self, ...)``.
No mixins, no per-model wiring — the shim is derived from capabilities.
