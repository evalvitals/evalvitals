"""ModelSpec — backend-orthogonal, per-model identity knowledge.

The key separation this module enforces:

  * **capabilities come from the BACKEND** (api / vllm_offline / hf_local),
  * **model identity comes from the SPEC** (this file).

One ``ModelSpec`` for, say, Qwen3-VL drives an API call, a vLLM batch-scoring
run, *and* an HF-eager attention capture — only the capability set differs.
``compose(spec, backend)`` (see :mod:`evalvitals.models.compose`) combines the
two into a :class:`~evalvitals.core.model.Model`.

This module is intentionally **dependency-free** (no torch / transformers), so it
imports on the light, pure-API install.  Module *paths* here are HINTS only: the
white-box backend RESOLVES them at load time against ``named_modules()`` rather
than trusting them, because they drift across transformers point-releases and
per-checkpoint wrappers (the doubled-``.model.`` / Llama4-no-``.model`` / v5
fused-experts traps).  Likewise token ids and merge sizes are read from the live
``config`` / processor, never hard-coded as values.
