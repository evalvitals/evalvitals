"""Pipeline — sklearn-style composition of analyzers.

Run several analyzers over the same ``(model, cases)`` and collect their
results under their step names::

    pipe = Pipeline([
        ("attention", AttentionAnalyzer(layer=-1)),
        # ("saliency", SaliencyAnalyzer()),   # Stage 2
    ])
    results = pipe.run(qwen, "The capital of France is")
    results["attention"].summary()

Each analyzer's capabilities are validated independently by its own ``run``.
Cross-step data flow (e.g. perturb → analyze) is a Stage-2 extension.
