"""Capability vocabulary — the contract between models and analyzers.

A *model* declares the capabilities it **provides** (e.g. a local Qwen exposes
``ATTENTION`` and ``HIDDEN_STATES``; an API model provides only ``GENERATE``).
An *analyzer* declares the capabilities it **requires**.  The registry matches
the two, so an agent can ask "what can I run on this model?" without touching
any model internals.
