"""Bundled Agent Skills shipped with the package.

Bundled skills (eval-chart-style, nature-figure, evalvitals-report-ui) are
applied BY DEFAULT on every skill-capable coding backend: claude/agy discover
them via the vendored ``<workdir>/.claude/skills/`` + the ``Skill`` tool, and
codex is pointed at the same vendored ``SKILL.md`` files through the workdir's
``AGENTS.md`` (it has no Skill tool). Pass ``--no-skills`` / empty ``skills``
to opt out.
