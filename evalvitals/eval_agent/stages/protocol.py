"""ExperimentProtocol — user-supplied description of what an experiment tests.

The protocol is the human prior that anchors the self-evolving loop:

- **M1** passes the protocol to :class:`~evalvitals.eval_agent.probe_agent.ProbeAgent`,
  which uses an LLM judge to select analyzers from the description.
- **M2** uses the protocol to frame its statistical narrative.
- **M5** uses it to verify that a hypothesis is consistent with what the user
  actually set out to investigate.

The description should be written in plain researcher language describing the
*task* and *observed behaviour*.  No failure-mode tags or internal jargon are
needed — the judge LLM interprets the text and selects relevant analyzers.

Usage::

    protocol = ExperimentProtocol(
        description=(
            "We test QwenVL on spatial reasoning. Given an image with two "
            "objects, the model frequently gives wrong left/right and "
            "above/below positions, and sometimes names objects not visible "
            "in the image at all."
        ),
        task_domain="spatial reasoning",
        success_criteria="Positions and object names must match what is visible.",
        target_modalities=frozenset({"text", "image"}),
    )
