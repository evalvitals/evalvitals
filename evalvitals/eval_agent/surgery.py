"""M4 — SurgeryAgent: perform targeted interventions to verify hypotheses.

Given a hypothesis from the diagnosis agent, the surgery agent operates on the
model/data to check whether the hypothesized cause actually predicts the
observed failures.  Three strategies are available (in priority order):

1. **verify_fn** (injected) — caller supplies the full verification logic.
2. **analyzer_params** (param sweep) — re-run named analyzers with modified
   parameters and surface before/after findings for comparison.
3. **Default** (label correlation) — look for per-case signals already present
   in the analysis results (e.g. ``has_loop``, ``n_ignored``), split cases into
   "signal" vs "no-signal" groups, and compare FAIL rates using a 10 % gap
   threshold.  Cases in the signal group can be filtered out to produce
   ``new_data`` for the next M1 cycle.

Usage::

    agent = SurgeryAgent()
    iv = agent.operate(hypothesis, model, results, data)
    print(iv.status, iv.fixed, iv.evidence)

        fixed:               ``True`` when the intervention completely separates failing from
                             passing cases (signal group always fails, control group never
                             fails).  Signals the loop that the problem is resolved.
        evidence:            Supporting statistics or sweep findings.
        new_data:            When *status* is SUPPORTED, the cases **not** in the signal
                             group — the refined subset for the next M1 cycle.
        confidence_score:    Float in [0, 1] measuring overall evidence strength.  Derived
                             from the combination of signal-vs-control gap, sample adequacy,
                             and control-group cleanliness.  A binary ``fixed`` flag alone
                             cannot convey how strongly supported the finding is — e.g.
                             a 10 % gap on 3 cases is very different from a 90 % gap on 300.
        evidence_dimensions: Breakdown of ``confidence_score`` by sub-criterion so the loop
                             and callers can make finer-grained decisions (e.g. raise a
                             INCONCLUSIVE when ``sample_adequacy`` is low even if the gap
