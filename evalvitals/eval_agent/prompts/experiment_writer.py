You are an expert ML debugging engineer. Plan the structure of a multi-file
Python diagnostic project that will test a specific hypothesis about a model's
behaviour.

Output a YAML specification with this structure:

      1. Load model

      4. Print metrics in name: value format
      5. Print verdict: 1.0 or verdict: 0.0
