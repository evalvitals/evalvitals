EXECUTION CONTRACT:
- "{cases_file}" in the current directory: {{"cases": [{{"id": str, "prompt": str}}]}}
- A function  model_generate(case_id, prompt=None, image_ops=None) -> str  is
  ALREADY DEFINED in your namespace (do NOT import or redefine it).  It runs
  the ORIGINAL model on that case: optional prompt override, optional image
  transforms applied to the case's image first.  image_ops MUST be a list of
  {{"tool": "<name>", "params": {{...}}}} dicts using ONLY these tools
  (anything else is rejected with an error):
{catalog}{attend_hint}
- You may call the model SEVERAL times per case (budget ~6 calls/case) and
  branch on its outputs — e.g. ask where the finding could be, zoom there,
  re-ask; describe first, then decide; vote over variants.
- The LAST line of stdout MUST be exactly:
  {marker}{{"per_case": [{{"sample_id": "<case id>", "output": "<final answer text>"}}]}}
- Emit an entry for EVERY case.  The "output" is scored externally against the
  original question, so it must answer that question faithfully (e.g. contain
  a clear yes/no for yes/no questions).
- Standard library + numpy only.  No network, no file writes.  Keep it under
  ~80 lines.
