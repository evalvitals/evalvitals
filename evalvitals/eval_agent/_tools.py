"""The agent's action space over the EvalVitals package.

The self-evolving agent doesn't reach into internals — it acts through this
thin tool layer, which wraps the registry, the analyzer/run machinery, and the
store.  Each function is one "skill" the agent can call.  Functions that only
forward to the core are implemented now; the ones needing the Stage-2 store or
case-generation raise ``NotImplementedError`` but already have their final
signatures, so the loop can be wired against them.

Design intent: this module *is* the contract between the agent and the package.
Keeping it small and uniform is what makes the agent able to drive the package
without bespoke glue.
