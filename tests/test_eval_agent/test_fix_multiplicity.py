"""Fix module: e-BH multiplicity control over the best-of-N candidate family.

Selecting the best of many candidates validated against the SAME baseline is a
multiple-comparisons hazard: each cleared only its own per-candidate gate
(e >= 1/alpha). A candidate is a winner only if it ALSO survives e-BH FDR across
the whole tested family (sole-survivor bar rises to m/alpha). These tests pin
that an underpowered best-of-N is correctly culled, while a single candidate and
a well-powered winner are unaffected.
